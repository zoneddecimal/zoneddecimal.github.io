Increasing the ISO is often referred to as increasing the sensitivity of the sensor.  In fact, this is not really true - the sensitivity of the sensor never really changes.  However, every camera comes with an analogue amplifier that attempts to boost the signal from the sensor.  This boosting is called applying analogue _gain_.  Ultimately, it is often a combination of gain and a post capture process called digital multiplication that results in the effect of ISO.
